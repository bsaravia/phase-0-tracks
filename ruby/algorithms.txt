This algorithm assumes a ton of things such as a built in people avoidance system, sensors of every type, advanced motors, etc. Essentially a person except for the brain. 

Walk towards elevator door

If you want to go up:
	if there exists a call up button
		until door is open, do:
			walk up to call buttons
			press call up button
			step back
			loop until 15 seconds have passed
				if door opens and there is space inside
					exit child and parent loop
				end
				wait 1 second
			end
			curse loudly
		end

	else
		sit on the floor and cry
	end

else If you want to go down:
	if there exists a call down button
		until door is open, do:
			walk up to call buttons
			press call down button
			step back

end

enter the elevator, locate buttons panel and walk in front of it
analyze all the buttons, assign them corresponding values


until you leave elevator

	if button (starting with first) equal to desired floor
		press it
	elseif move on to next button (make a loop)
	end

	wait for elevator to open on the floor you want then exit (loop and elevator)
	if not, wait (10*# of floors) seconds then run above loop again, up to 5 times

	if that doesnt work,
	live the rest of your life in this elevator
	find purpose in life by becoming elevator operator

end

walk out, whistling awkwardly
