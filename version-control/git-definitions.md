# Git Definitions

**Instructions:** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  * Version control is a software tool that facilitates the process of having more than one person work on a project by creating different independent versions of an original file that can later be compared and merged if deemed appropriate. It is useful to prevent miscommunication and conflicting changes that can slow down or ruin a project. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  * [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/) defines a branch as an "independent line of development". They are tools that help you manage the different versions of your project by clearly identifying when different versions are separated or merged. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  * A commit is basically a save point and needs to be done before any pulling or pushing can happen. A good commit message is very specific and clear not just to the author but to everyone.
* What is a merge conflict?
  * A situation in which the different versions of your project cannot be reconciled due to directly conflicting modifications. These must be resolved manually.
